						<h2>My Education</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a B.A. in Geography under the Geospatial Information Systems and Technology concentration.
						I also got a minor in english to help convey the need for GIS to people who know little about it. </p>
					</p> In addition to my classes, I participate in several extracirriculars. I am currently serving as Co-President for the University of Tennessee Association
					for Geographers and Sustainers, as a Undergraduate Representative to my department, and on the College of Arts and Sciences Dean's Student Advisory Council. Additionally, I 
					perform with the University of Tennessee Pride of the Southland Marching and the UT Wind Ensemble.

						<h2>How did I become a geography major?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I originally was admitted to UT Knoxville as a pre-law major and was aspiring to attend law school after completing my undergrad; however, I took
						introductory geography courses as part of the general education cirriculum and keep learning about the different areas of geography until I found GIS 
						and I immediately began studying the world of spatial data. Eventually, I committed to the major and become a student at the Department of Geography and Sustainability.</p>
					</p> I am now enjoying working as a professional in GIS and am very eager to learn more...</p>

						<h2>My Experience</h2>
						<p>My first professional experience was interning for Judge John Aaron Holt, who currently is the residing judge of Davidson County's 
							General Sessions Court, Division XI, in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
					    </p> During my junior year, I worked at Paine, Tarwater, and Bickers, LLC, as an office runner. Both experiences provided an incredible 
						experience and taught me about the legal system as well as ideas in law that will be very useful in any industry.</p>
						</p> However, I later earned a position as a GIS Technical Intern at WSP-USA, where I currently am working on several projects
						for Government, Municipal, Commericial, and Military projects. Gaining real-world experience before graduating allowed me to practice concepts I 
						had learned in class as well as develop professional skills.</p>

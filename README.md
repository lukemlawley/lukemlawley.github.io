## More About Me
I am currently a senior geography-GIST major at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://www.utk.edu/) and will be graduating May 2023! I originally 
was admitted to UT as a pre-professional law major. As much as I enjoyed my experiences with the legal field, I realized that my interest in geography was going to 
persist. So I declared the major the summer before my junior year. Some of the skills I enjoy most include raster analysis, geodatabase design and management, and
network analysis in transportation systems!
